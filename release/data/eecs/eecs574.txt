Title: EECS574

Name:  Computational Complexity

Credits: 4

Description: Fundamentals of the theory of computation and complex theory. Computatability, undecidability, and logic. Relations between complexity classes, NP-completeness, P-completeness, and randomized computation. Applications in selected areas such as cryptography, logic programming, theorem proving, approximation of optimization problems, or parallel computing.
